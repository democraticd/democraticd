Democracy + open source + server
= A democratic daemon

You install the democratic daemon on your server, and it immediately kicks you off the system.
It changes the root password, closes down ttys and sshd and removes
them from the startup process.
It starts a web service providing the only way to make changes to the system:
Users sign up, and can propose code changes (git pull/patch) which a majority of users must vote for before the live code is updated. This is the only way to change the system.

You are now running an open-source democratic internet service, enforced by the democratic daemon.
Want to run a mail server, change the voting rules, or just the font on the front page?
Submit a code change!
All live code is pushed to an off-server repository in case of catastrophic failure.

Features:
- Delegative democracy so non-devs can use it, + you can say "Auto vote for changes that both Bob & Emily vote for".
- Server forking (including db data) for contentious issues and niche communities.
- Users might pay subscriptions, and vote for funding devs & paying server costs.
- Modular code so votes can carry forward between changes.
